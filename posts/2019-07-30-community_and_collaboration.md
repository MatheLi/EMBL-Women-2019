Today we discussed my work as a Community Manager at EMBL, while Maria-Theresa got to sit with me during Bio-IT's weekly drop-in sessions. I told her about the roles of community managers in the current collaborative world of science. I also shared with her the challenges I faced in my current job while choosing to dedicate my full-time in community management, which meant I couldn't do research anymore - simply because I didn't have time for that. 

Nevertheless, being a community person is who I am, and what I enjoy the most. Part of my responsibilities is to learn and bring best practices of Open Science at my workplace and share them with others. This doesn't mean that I had to be an expert on everything or even know everything. If I know who I can point to for a particular skill that can improve someone's work, that's a win for everyone involved. So collaboration is the key, either you are a researcher or a community manager.

Staying on the theme of **collaboration**, we spent the morning working on GitHub on collaborative repositories. Her first project was to learn about the different things you can do with GitHub. We did semi-supervised learning where I shared [this introductory material](https://github.com/malvikasharan/developing_collaborative_document) with her, which I had adapted from [materials developed by Kirstie Whitaker](https://github.com/KirstieJane/friendly-github-intro) with [Mozilla Science Lab](https://science.mozilla.org/). After a lunch with my lab members, we collaboratively worked on setting gitpages, one for [her homepage](https://matheli.github.io/Matheli/) and another for this project. She enjoyed this process of setting her website, but I promised her that we will use command-line to use `Git` during her next visit. 

We finished our day by recording a small interview with her which I will share in our next post.
