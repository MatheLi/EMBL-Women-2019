# EMBL Teen Project

***[EMBL = European Molecular Biology Laboratory](https://embl.de)***

*From August to September, the 'Friends of EMBL' department is running a small project - 'Women in Science', with EMBL Teens, an EMBL club for high school students interested in life sciences. Each girl has been paired with a women researcher at EMBL where they will take mentorship roles as a mentee and mentor. The EMBL researcher will introduce their mentees to their research work, their life as a scientist and a few important skills that have been useful for them. As part of the European Researchersâ€™ Night that will take place at EMBL on 27 September 2019, an exhibition will be organised to show their work in the form of visual display, video or presentation.*

This page will summarise the work of Maria-Theresa - an EMBL teen, who is learning about computational biology, data analysis, and artificial intelligence in her spare time, and Malvika Sharan - a computational biologist and community outreach coordinator at EMBL.
